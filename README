GAMP is a very lightweight system completion for libc functions and virtually any other functions.

REQUIREMENTS
  Mandatory:
    * Linux-like OS with a shell and a manpage system
    * Vim 'laststatus' must be set to 2
  Optional:
    * GNU Global (its use can be disabled)

FEATURES
  * Perfect for C, C++ and theorically support other C syntax-like languages (PHP, Java)
  * 3 modes:
    * Complete function prototype in completion mode
    * Hint for function prototype in statusline mode
    * Do all of the above when using both modes
  * Take definition from all the function manpages from section 2 and 3
    ( system and library (including libc) calls )
  * Take definition of any function using GNU Global GTags system
  * If not using Global GTags, there is no dependency
  * Real-time updating and no maintenance required if using  gtags.vim  
    auto-update feature

USAGE EXAMPLE
In completion mode:
        printf ||                       /* "||" is the cursor */
    After pressing <Leader>gmc  becomes:
        print|f| ( {+const_char_pt_format+}, {+VA_Args+} )
    Use <C-j> to jump to next argument:
        printf ( ||, {+VA_Args+} )
        printf ( "GAMP mark: %d/10"||, {+VA_Args+} )
    And again:
        printf ( "GAMP mark: %d/10", || )
        printf ( "GAMP mark: %d/10", 10|| )

In statusline mode:
        printf (const char *format, ...)
     Is displayed on statusline.
